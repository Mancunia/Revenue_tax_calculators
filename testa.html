<p>The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) was established in 2009 as a merger of the three revenue agencies, the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Value Added Tax Service (VATS) and the Revenue Agencies Governing Board (RAGB) in accordance with the Ghana Revenue Authority Act 2009, (Act 791).</p>



<p>Our core mandate is to ensure maximum compliance with all relevant laws in order to ensure a sustainable revenue stream for government, trade facilitation and a controlled and safe flow of goods across the country’s borders.</p>



<p>We also administer a number of international agreements that govern our relations with other tax jurisdictions and institutions such as World Customs Organisation Protocols, World Trade Organisation Protocols, Double Taxation and Exchange of Information Agreements.</p>



<p>Since 2009, GRA has been introducing new technology, which will make it convenient and cheaper for taxpayers to file returns, pay taxes and comply with tax laws. Two key products that were introduced in 2018 were the Integrated Tax Application and Preparation Systems (iTaPS) and the Excise Tax Stamp Authenticator (ETSA).</p>

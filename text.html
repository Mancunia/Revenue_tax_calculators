    <p><strong>Large Tax Office (LTO)</strong></p>
    
    
    
    <p>The Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has modernized all domestic tax procedures and processes for efficient use of resources and in line with best practice in tax administration. In modernising, GRA also seeks to provide improved taxpayer services that meet the specific needs of groups of taxpayers in Ghana.The reform process involved in segmenting domestic taxpayers into Large, Medium and Small taxpayers is based on their annual turnover and other criteria.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Taxpayers with an annual turnover of over <strong>GH5 million</strong> are classified as Large Taxpayers. This category also includes specialist industries irrespective of their turnover. Examples are upstream and midstream petroleum companies, banking institutions, insurance companies, mining companies except quarries, and members of groups of companies where at least one member qualifies as a large taxpayer. All LTO taxpayers are on the self-assessment regime. Taxpayers within the turnover bracket of <strong>GH¢90,000</strong> up to <strong>GH¢5 million</strong> are categorized as medium taxpayers while those with an annual turnover of less than GH¢90,000 are classified as Small taxpayers.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>This new approach to tax administration is based on functional lines rather than the previous tax-type basis of administration. Work processes have been developed on functions such as registration, returns processing, debt management and audit which are carried out in a typical domestic tax office.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>WHAT IS LTO</strong></p>
    
    
    
    <p>The Large Taxpayer Office (LTO) is a Department Under the Domestic Tax Revenue Division (DTRD) of the GRA. It operates as a specialized tax office focusing exclusively on total tax administration of Large taxpayers identified by the GRA. It also offers a one-stop-shop for taxpayers with regard to all activities related to taxpayer obligations as well as the Tax Authority’s obligations to taxpayers. The office is headed by a deputy commissioner.</p>

            <section>
                <p>In pursuit of best practice in tax administration, the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) has modernized the domestic tax procedures for efficient use of resources, also for the purposes of providing taxpayer services that meets the particular needs of taxpayers in the country. The reform process involves segmentation of domestic taxpayers into Large, Medium and Small taxpayers based on their annual turnover.</p>
    
    
    
                <p>Taxpayers with an annual turnover of over GH₵5 million are classified as Large taxpayers. This category also includes specialist industries irrespective of their turnover. These are upstream and institutions, insurance companies, mining companies and quarries, and members of groups of companies where at least one member qualifies as a large taxpayer.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taxpayers within the turnover bracket of GH₵90,000 up to GH₵5million are categorized as Medium taxpayers whiles those with an annual turnover of less than GH₵90,000 are classified as Small taxpayers.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>This new approach to tax administration is based on functional lines rather the previous tax-type basis of administration. Therefore, typical work processes in a domestic tax office such as registration, returns processing, debt management and audit can be carried within these one-stop-shop offices for efficiency.</p>

Special attention is focused on the needs and requirements of medium taxpayers in an MTO.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>Taxpayers within this bracket, like those in the Large Taxpayer Office use the Self-Assessment approach for all taxes they pay.</p>
                
                
                
                <ul><li><strong>Purpose of MTO?</strong></li><li>To provide sufficient attention to the needs of medium taxpayers</li><li>To administer taxes along functional lines which would allow for specialization and professionalization of workforce.
